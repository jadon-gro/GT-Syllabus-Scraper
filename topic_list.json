Faculty supervising individual projects may impose additional requirements or constraints.\r\n\r\nRegular Progress Reports -- Minimum of four periodic (weekly reporting may be required) progress reports, including both team and individual contributions.\r\n\r\nFormal Written Design Proposal/Preliminary Design Review (PDR) -- Each design team must submit a formal written project proposal or PDR to enable evaluation of the projects feasibility/progress and the technical approach and to identify quantitative project specifications.\r\n\r\nProposal/PDR Oral Presentation (requires significant participation by each team member) -- The proposal/PDR presentation should be prepared using standard presentation software and include an introduction with project overview, motivation, and relevance; relevant coverage of all written report elements; and be presented at an abstraction level appropriate to the project scenario and audience.\r\n\r\nFinal Written Report -- Each design team must submit a formal, written final report that is sufficient to allow project replication by a suitable engineering team, or, if appropriate, project continuation by another student team.\r\n\r\nFinal Oral Presentation (requires significant participation by each team member) -- The final presentation should include all the characteristics of the Proposal/PDR Presentation with the addition of an emphasis on results.\r\n\r\nProject Demonstration -- Prior to the end of the semester, each team must demonstrate their project to their faculty advisor and compare functional results with project design goals and specifications.  This demonstration could take place either during the final presentation or at a mutually convenient time.  If the project is not suitable for a final demonstration, then some visual representation of project functionality should appear in the final presentation.\r\n\r\nPeer evaluation -- Each design team should participate in a formal peer review process to assess both team and individual performance at both the project proposal and the project completion stages.\r\n", "4011": "Topical Outline\n1.Introduction to Engineering Design\r\n   a.Definition of engineering design\r\n   b.Description of the engineering design processes, formal models\r\n   c.Problem formulation tools ; needs, requirements, specifications, risk/reward trade-offs\r\n2.Professional Practice Issues\r\n   a.Professionalism and its responsibilities, licensure\r\n   b.Engineering ethics, models and examples\r\n   c.Standards and codes\r\n   d.Legal issues, including intellectual property and liability\r\n3.Probabilistic Elements in Design\r\n   a.Basic probability distribution models, functions of single and multiple random variables\r\n   b.Manufacturing variation and the effect on product design\r\n   c.Defects, yield, and reliability\r\n   d.Engineering measurement fundamentals\r\n4.Engineering Economics and Decision Making\r\n   a.Basic financial principles, Time-value-of-money analysis\r\n   b.Applications in engineering design, life-cycle costs, benefit-cost analysis\r\n5.Project Management\r\n   a.Project scheduling and time estimation\r\n   b.Project budgeting and job costing\r\n   c.Project documentation\r\n6.Project Definition, Development, and Team Forming\r\n   a.Team forming rules and project deliverables\r\n   b.Technical Review Paper instructions\r\n   c.Project Summary Form instructions \r\n   d.Project Proposal instructions and required technical content\r\n   e.Critical Review I: Project Proposal report\r\n", "4012": "Topical Outline\nWorking in teams, students will complete  the second semester of their two-semester design project requiring specification, design, implementation, and testing.
